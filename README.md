## Neighborhood Map Project

Here is my version of the neighborhood map project: Best Museums of NYC

# How to run?
To run the site, got to https://gosiam.github.io/neighborhood_map/

At first the map shows you all 5 great NYC museums. By clicking on any  particular Museum on the nav bar or by selecting through a search, the map will zoom in and an infowindow with Forsquare basic content will show up.

If you need more information about a museum, you can click on the links to the venue or Forsquare page. This will take you to a detailed webpage. 

Enjoy!
